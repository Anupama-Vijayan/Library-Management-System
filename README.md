# Library-Management-System

A web based online Library system with end to end functionalities using MySQL for backend and HTML, CSS, JQuery, AJAX, PHP for the front end.

The website was designed to replicate a library system. There are two user types for the system, admin and library patron. The functionality for the library patrons will include the ability to browse the library catalog, save searches, place holds, and create list of books that he or she is interested in. The admin on the other hand will be able to check out books on behalf of the patron and maintain the books in the catalog including editing, adding, and deleting books in the system. The system is built to reflect a library system that has more than one branch, and has several types of material: physical books, movies, and magazines. In the creation of the system, several assumptions were made. Firstly, the only way for a patron to check out a book is for the admin to log in and check out the book on their behalf.
